2006-04-14  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* MorphOS: Don't allocate temporary pens when rendering to
	truecolor screens anymore (like OS4).

2006-04-14  Jörg Strohmayer <nospam@gmx.de>

	* Made the persistent cache work on AmigaOS and added
          PERSISTENTCACHE argument/tooltype.

	* Added SLOWMOUSE argument/tooltype, like NOMOUSE it reduces
	  the traffic sent to the server a lot, but unlike NOMOUSE it
	  still sends some mouse movements.

2006-04-12  Jörg Strohmayer <nospam@gmx.de>

	* Added a workaround for the def_drawer as iconify icon problem
	  when started from a RDesktopGUI which was started from
	  Workbench.

	* "Connection bar" is now only shown/hidden when the mouse
	  pointer is in-/outside of the connection bar window instead
	  of the complete top of the screen.

2006-04-11  Jörg Strohmayer <nospam@gmx.de>

	* Added sticky gadget and screen dragging to the connection bar.

2006-04-10  Jörg Strohmayer <nospam@gmx.de>

	* Iconify now works even if there is no icon.

2006-04-09  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.4.1 (09.04.2006).

	* Updated to rdesktop 1.4.1 baseline sources.

2006-04-09  Jörg Strohmayer <nospam@gmx.de>

	* Small AmigaOS4 bugfixes, no longer opens interfaces which can
	  be opened by libauto.a, added some optimizations for high- and
	  true-colour screens.

	* Removed unsupported BITMAPSONLY argument/tooltype.

2006-04-08  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Close the screen before exiting, if a window can't be created on
	it (in fullscreen mode).

	* Made Jörgs no-more-requesters code active for all targets.

2006-04-08  Jörg Strohmayer <nospam@gmx.de>
	* Added "connection bar" in fullscreem mode (AmigaOS4 and high-/
	  truecolor-screens only).

	* AmigaOS4: Added an option to the error requesters to disable
	  them and switch to console error output.

	* AmigaOS4: Disabled C library <ctrl><c> handling.

	* Added checks in wave_out_close() to prevent closing
	  ahi.device, it's IORequest and MsgPort twice.

2006-03-07  Jörg Strohmayer <nospam@gmx.de>
        * Changed AmigaOS4 SSL code from AmiSSL v1 to v3.

        * Added MouseWheel support.

2005-02-06  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (05.02.2005).

	* The default keyboard layout in Windows is now set based on
	country, since the kaymap name was not really reliable. You can
	still override using the KEYMAP argument of course.

2005-01-29  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Added CapsLock sync.

	* Added NumLock sync when running under OS4.

	* RDesktop now detects OS4/MOS at runtime instead of compile
	time. This makes the keymap code work even when the m68k binary is
	run under OS4.

	* Added OS4 TCP and keymap patch from Jörg.

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (29.01.2005).

2005-01-28  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Tweaked numeric keypad '*'. On its own, it sends 'keypad
	*'. Used with Control, it now sends Print Screen. This should make
	Print Screen available on classic keyboards too.

	* Ctrl-Pause now sends Break. Unfortunately, this key combination
	does not generate a keycode in MorphOS. In OS4 perhaps?

	* Added NumLock support in OS4, thanks to info from Jörg
	Strohmayer.

2005-01-26  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* NewMouse support was accidentally disabled in the m68k build.

	* OS4 now sends Scroll Lock when the Help key (which is Scroll
	Lock!) is pressed (untested). Help still sends Windows Menu in
	Classic and MorphOS.

	* Enabled Windows Menu key in OS4 (untested).

	* Enabled PrtScr in MorphOS and (untested) OS4.

	* When checking for RAmiga-Q, use MapRawKey() instead of raw key
	code. [Stéphane Guillard]

	* Added the KEYMAP command line switch and tool type.

	* Automatically sets the keyboard layout on the Windows side,
	based on the Amiga layout. If you have one of the following
	layouts, you may want to verify that the correct Windows layout is
	used in amiga_rdesktop.c, since I had to guess a lot:
	1251Q_US_RUS, 1251_GB1_RUS, 1251_GB_RUS, a, be, br, br2,
	br3-ABNT2, cat, cdn, cdn2, e, gr, oe, Russian, si, türkçe.

2005-01-17  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* <itix> HammerD: btw, TAG_MORE is "jmp", not "jsr"
	  <itix> in the source code, openwindowtags()

2005-01-16  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (16.01.2005).

	* RAmiga-Q now disconnects.

2005-01-15  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Added mouse wheel support (NewMouse).

2005-01-13  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (13.01.2005).

	* More OS4 patches from Jörg, including a fix for a potential
	memory trash when using exess tooltypes.

2005-01-12  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (12.01.2005).

	* Merged Jörgs patches (OS4 port, excess are tooltypes ignored,
	gcc 3.x fixes). Thanks!

2005-01-12  Jörg Strohmayer <j_s@gmx.de>

        * Ported to AmigaOS4.

2005-01-08  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (08.01.2005).

	* Ignore zero-size clipboard announcements from the Windows
	side. Also ignore clipboard announcements about anything except
	plain text data, since we can't handle that.

	* Try harder to satisfy outstanding CBD_POST requests at exit
	(window close gadget, CTRL-C), using real Windows clipboard data
	if possible.

2005-01-07  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (07.01.2005).

	* If we have an outstanding clipboard.device CBD_POST when we
	exit, just wite empty data to the clipboard to satisfy it.

	* Don't change cursor image in Amithlon (since it's broken).

2005-01-06  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (06.01.2005).

	* Fixed some minor bugs in the clipboard handling code.

2005-01-05  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (05.01.2005).

	* Added hatch patterns to ui_patblt().

	* The pattern in ui_patblt() seems to be inverted. This fixes the
	missing grid in Microsoft Outlook and also made the lasso in
	Explorer appear.

	* Picasso96 and CyberGraphX do not handle minterm 0x00 or 0xf0
	correctly. :-( Detect this and use RectFill() instead. This fixes
	bad colors in Microsoft Outlook.

	* Avoid 'ERROR: send: Bad file descriptor' when terminating
	RDesktop while audio is streaming.

2004-12-30  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (30.12.2004).

	* Finished clipboard support. It requires clipboard.device 50.2 or
	higher in MorphOS!
    
2004-12-19  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (19.12.2004).

	* Ported RDesktop to (optionally) use libnix instead of ixemul. It
	works both for m68k-amigaos and ppc-morphos.

2004-12-11  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* printercache.c: Use ENVARC:, not $HOME.

2004-05-30  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (30.05.2004).

	* When connecting to a Windows Server, the path for the client
	license was ENVARC:RDesktop/RDesktop/licence.<host>. Changed to
	ENVARC:RDesktop/license.<host>, as that's what the ReadMe file
	says. Sorry chaps.

2004-05-28  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released version 1.3.1cvs (28.05.2004).

	* Display error/warning requesters on the same screen as where the
	RDesktop window is.

2004-05-28  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released beta 4.

2004-05-27  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Now keeps some temporary bitmaps allocated until program exit
	too.

2004-05-26  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Release beta 3.

	* Use BltBitMapRastPort() instead of ClipBlit() for fullscreen
	sessions. For window sessions, use we have to remove the clip
	region, ClipBlit() into a temporary bitmap, reinstall the clip
	region and then BltBitMapRastPort() back. Sigh.

	* Added a couple of really nice PNG icons by André Siegel.

	* Keep a temporary blit buffer allocated until program exit, so we
	don't have to allocate/free memory all the time.

2004-05-24  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released beta 2.

	* Added workaround for missing minterm handling in
	CyberGraphX. Fixed a bug in text rendering. => mIRC looks ok.

	* New port based on a upstream snapshot made on 2004-04-17. Works
	with Windows XP, has sound.

	* Non-working, never released update based on rdesktop 1.1.0.

2001-10-28  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* First AmigaOS version.
