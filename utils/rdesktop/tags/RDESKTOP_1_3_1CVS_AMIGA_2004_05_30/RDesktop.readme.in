Purpose:        To connect to a Windows NT Terminal Server


Introduction:

RDESKTOP [1] is a free client for the RDP protocol. It works as a
"thin client" which you use to connect to Windows
NT4TS/2000/2003/XP. RDESKTOP was created by Samba team member Matthew
Chapman and released under the GNU Public License. It runs on many
operating systems: several flavours of Unix/Linux, Acorn, Amiga, Mac
OS X, OS/2 etc. It has even been ported to Win32 and Java. [2]

This version of RDESKTOP runs on OCS (barely) and AGA Amigas running
@OS_VERSION_AGA@ in 8 bit color mode, and on graphic card equipped
computers running @OS_VERSION_GFX@ in either 8 bit color mode
or true-color mode (15, 16 and 25 bit color depths are supported).

It was ported by Martin Blom, who also did a previous Amiga port
(version 2001-10-28). This port, however, is using a much more recent
Unix snapshot, which makes it work correctly with Windows XP and adds
loads of new features. It is also much more "Amigaized" than the last
version. Darren Eveland and BBRV/Genesi made it happen. Thanks to
André 'Jobbo' Siegel for the gorgeous PNG icons and Sigbjørn Skjæret
for additional beta testing.


Specification:

In the simplest case, RDESKTOP is invoked with the host name of the
Windows server as sole argument. This will open a window on the
default public screen and connect using RDP5 in 8 bit mode. The window
will be 80% or the screen size, which is (approximately) 640x480 on an
800x600 screen, 800x600 on a 1024x768 screen etc.

The dimensions, in pixels, of the window (or screen -- see the
FULLSCREEN switch below) can be set using the WIDTH and HEIGHT
arguments. If negative, the percentage of the screen size is used
instead. The DEPTH argument is used to specify the RDP server depth,
useful when running in window mode on a true-color public
screen. Valid values are 8, 15, 16 or 24. LEFT and TOP specify the
position of the window, in pixels, from the left and top edges of the
screen, respectively.

The public screen to open on is specified by using the PUBSCREEN
argument. The window title can be set by using the TITLE argument.

By using the FULLSCREEN switch, RDESKTOP will open a screen of its
own. Unless SCREENMODE is also used to specify the mode number, in
decimal or (MorphOS version only) hex using the '0x' prefix, a
screen mode requester will appear before connecting to the
server. DEPTH is automatically taken from the requester or, if a
true-color screen mode is specified, the screen mode.

Audio will be redirected automatically. Use the AUDIO argument to
specify the AHI unit to use (default is 0). The REMOTEAUDIO switch can
be used to leave audio enabled on the remote side instead.

The user name can be specified by using the USER argument and the
windows domain by using the DOMAIN argument. The password can be set
by using the PASSWORD switch. The special password "-" will make
RDESKTOP ask for the password before connecting.

To override the client host name, use the CLIENT argument. The client
name is used when loading TSE licenses. These licenses are expected to
be available as "ENVARC:RDesktop/license.<name>".

When using the French version of NT TSE, the FRENCH switch must be
used to disable encryption. The NOENCRYPTION switch can be used on
other servers to disable encryption after the initial login packets
have been sent. Note that this means that interactive logins will be
unencrypted!

Windows 2003 Server allows the user to attach to the console using
RDP. This is activated by using the CONSOLE switch. 

The startup shell can be specified by using the SHELL argument. The
default working directory can be set by using DIRECTORY. The default
shell is the Windows Explorer (i.e., the normal Windows desktop).

Finally, there are a couple of arguments that influence what is sent
over the network. Use BITMAPSONLY to ask the server to send all
graphics as bitmaps instead of high-level drawing operations. NOMOUSE
makes RDESKTOP not send any mouse movements to the server in order to
save bandwidth. The EXPERIENCE argument, which can be 28K8, 56K, DSL
or LAN, disables certain behaviours. The default is 56K.

  * LAN disables nothing
  * DSL disables the desktop wallpaper
  * 56K disables wallpaper, solid window moving and menu animations
  * 28K8 disables wallpaper, solid window moving, menu animations and
    theming.

The RDP4 switch disables the RDP v5 protocol.

(When running from @DESKTOP@, the special ixemul tooltype WINDOW may or
may not be interpreted as a window string for the console window.)


Example 1:

1> RDESKTOP winserver

connects to the Windows server "winserver" in 8 bit window mode.


Example 2:

1> RDESKTOP WIDTH 800 HEIGHT -50 DEPTH 16 winserver

connects to the Windows server "winserver" in 16 bit true-color window
mode. The usable area of the window with be 800 pixels wide and half
of the screen height (50%) tall.


Example 3:

1> RDESKTOP FULLSCREEN winserver 

connects to the Windows server "winserver" in fullscreen mode. A
screenmode requester will first appear, where you can select the
resolution and depth for the session.


Example 4:

4> RDESKTOP REMOTEAUDIO SCREENMODE=2195460 WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=512
   DEPTH=5 NOENCRYPTION NOMOUSE EXPERIENCE=28k8 winserver

opens an OCS compatible PAL Hires Laced 640x512 screen with 32 colors,
connects to "winserver" with encryption turned off and audio left
enabled on the server. No mouse movements are sent and all "extras",
like wallpapers and solid window moving are disabled. The remote
windows desktop will be in 256 color mode, even though the Amiga only
displays 32 colors. Don't expect miracles.
