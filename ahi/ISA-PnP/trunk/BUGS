Known bugs and missing features:

* Memory resources not handled at all.

* If an independent descriptor follows after dependent functions,
  the descriptor numbers will be wrong.

* Cards with only 10 bit IO decoding will not reserve IO areas where
  a15-a10 != 0.

* Fixed resources, used by non-PnP ISA cards, cannot be reserved yet.  This
  means that the resource allocation algorithm may assign resources to PnP
  cards that are already in use by non-PnP cards.

* Some cards, like the Creative SB32 PnP, does not request all resources
  it requires.  ISA-PnP should know about this and add the missing
  resources.

* For each configured logical device, ISA-PnP should be able to run a 
  shell script with information about the resources allocated. For example,
  a shell script could create the ENV:SANA2/gg_ne2000.config_0 file
  automatically.
