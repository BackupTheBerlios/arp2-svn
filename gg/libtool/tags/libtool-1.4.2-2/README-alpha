global_symbol_pipe
******************

CALL FOR HELP: In order to implement dlopening even on archictectures
that don't have shared libraries, I am collecting `NM' and
`global_symbol_pipe' values for every known operating system.

If ltconfig on your system says that it found the command to parse NM
output, then you don't need to look any further:

checking command to parse /usr/bin/nm output... yes

Otherwise, I would very much appreciate hearing about the combination
of `NM' and `global_symbol_pipe' that ltconfig needs to use in order
to pass this test.

`NM' is set by ltconfig to be an nm program that gives BSD-compatible
symbol output, such as:

$ nm assert-perr.o
         U _IO_stderr_
00000000 T __assert_perror_fail
         U __assert_program_name
         U abort
         U fflush
         U fprintf
         U strerror

If your OS's nm cannot produce output like this, that's still okay,
but, for simplicity, I prefer using this kind of output.

Then, global_symbol_pipe is a command that takes all exported symbols,
including undefined ones, and produces a two-column list of them.  The
contents of the first column are the raw symbol name, and the second
column contains the name needed to access the symbols from a C
program.

So, on most OSes, this will be a command like:

$ nm assert-perr.o | \
  sed -e '/^.* [BCDEGRSTU] \([_A-Za-z][_A-Za-z0-9]*\)$/!d'
      -e 's/^.* [BCDEGRSTU] \([_A-Za-z][_A-Za-z0-9]*\)$/\1 \1/'
_IO_stderr_ _IO_stderr_
__assert_perror_fail __assert_perror_fail
__assert_program_name __assert_program_name
abort abort
fflush fflush
fprintf fprintf
strerror strerror

On some OSes, the C symbols will need to strip a leading underscore:

$ nm assert-perr.o | \
  sed -e '/^.* [BCDEGRSTU] _\([_A-Za-z][_A-Za-z0-9]*\)$/!d'
      -e 's/^.* [BCDEGRSTU] _\([_A-Za-z][_A-Za-z0-9]*\)$/_\1 \1/'
__IO_stderr_ _IO_stderr_
___assert_perror_fail __assert_perror_fail
___assert_program_name __assert_program_name
_abort abort
_fflush fflush
_fprintf fprintf
_strerror strerror
