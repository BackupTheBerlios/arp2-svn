	* quote.test (echo): Update the echo test from ../ltconfig.in.

1998-03-08  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* tlibtool: Eliminate from distribution.

	* defs (libtool): Don't use tlibtool anymore, since we can now use
	the generated libtool directly.

1998-02-18  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* sh.test (scripts): Remove the lineno script, since it is no
	longer distributed.

	* assign.test, if.test, test-e.test: Even though 15 tests looks
 	impressive, these are now redundant.  Remove them from the
 	distribution.

	* sh.test: Do what assign.test, if.test, and test-e.test used to
 	do.

1998-02-16  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

 	portability on MS-DOS.  From Robert Hoehne.

1997-09-15  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* hardcode.test (objdir): New variable to simplify change from
	.libs to _libs (MS-DOS portability fix).

1997-09-05  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo-exec.test, demo-inst.test: Change references from
	hell.static to hell.debug.

1997-06-30  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* if.test: New test to make sure that we haven't forgotten to
	follow an `if' statement with a `test' command.  This should avoid
	the majority of hard-to-track bugs.

1997-06-19  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo-conf.test (CONFIG_SITE): Set to /dev/null, so that the
	config.site file doesn't mess up our prefix.  Reported by Joel
	Weber.

	* demo-inst.test: Always run both hell.static and hell.

	* demo-conf.test: Always remove the local config.cache, but run
	`make distclean' only if the Makefile exists.  Otherwise, the demo
	directory is not cleaned up if a user uses their own config.cache.
	Reported by Joel Weber.

1997-04-16  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* hardcode.test: AIX also has arbitrary limits on the line length
	of input to fgrep(1), so we need to translate NUL characters to
	newlines in order to properly detect embedded `.libs'.  From Bruno
	Haible.
	Also redirect stderr to /dev/null, so that AIX users don't get
	worried by `fgrep: Maximum line length of 2048 exceeded.'.

1997-04-01  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* hardcode.test: AIX 3 doesn't have strings(1) so we need to do a
	funny tr and pipe the output to fgrep.  From Bruno Haible.

1997-02-03  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (TESTS): Do the full make sequence with
	--disable-shared, then without.

	--disable-shared.

1997-01-29  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* hardcode.test: Rewrite to use fgrep on output from ``strings
 	-a'' if using fgrep directly on the binary files fails.  From Mark
 	Kettenis.

1997-01-28  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* hardcode.test: Make sure that ../demo/libhello.la really is a
	shared library before running hardcoding tests.

1997-01-18  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo-conf.test: Use the CONFIG_SHELL environment variable when
 	running configure in the demo directory.  From Bruno Haible.

	* Makefile.am (clean-local): Make distclean in the demo directory,
	so that ``make clean; env CC=cc make check'' works as one would
	expect.

	* demo-make.test: Fix typo (use $make instead of make).  Reported
 	by Akim Demaille.

1997-01-16  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* tlibtool: Rewrote to grab all the settings from the generated
	libtool script.

	* hardcode.test: Make allowances if shlibpath_var cannot be used
	to find libraries at link time, such as on AIX.

1997-01-14  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo-conf.test, demo-inst.test, demo-unst.test, hardcode.test:
 	Use $make instead of make.

	* defs (make): Add definition of $make that uses the $MAKE
	environment variable, if set.  Suggested by Bruno Haible.

	* demo-unst.test (leftovers): Change the find command to ignore
	files beginning with a dot, as egrep -v doesn't seem to do the
	trick.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

1997-01-13  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* hardcode.test: Added a test to make sure that libtool's idea of
	hardcoding system linkers is correct.

1997-01-03  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (distclean-local): Remove all files that the tests
	may have created.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* For all tests, discover srcdir when running from the command
	line.

	* demo-unst.test: Don't fail if make uninstall doesn't delete
 	files beginning with a dot, since spurious .nfsXXX files may be
 	present when running NFS.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

1997-01-02  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* suffix.test: New test to guarantee that libtool compile
 	recognizes valid source file suffices.

1996-12-08  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo.test: Break up into demo-conf.test, demo-make.test,
	demo-exec.test, demo-inst.test, and demo-unst.test, so that passes
	and failures are reported more quickly.

	* link-2.test: Test to make sure that .lo files don't get built
	directly into programs.

1996-12-07  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* tlibtool: A typically-configured libtool script, that uses
	../ltmain.sh.in for its backend.

	* link.test: Make sure that it is legal to link against .a files.

1996-12-02  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo.test: Try compiling the ../demo subdirectory, with no
	special options.

	* test-e.test: Check that we haven't used `test -e' anywhere in
	our portable shell scripts.
