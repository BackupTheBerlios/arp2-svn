.description
Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce both on-line information and printed output.  This means that
instead of writing two different documents, one for the on-line help
or other on-line information and the other for a typeset manual or
other printed work, you need write only one document.  When the work
is revised, you need revise only one document.  One way to read the
on-line information, known as an "Info file", is with an Info
documentation-reading program. An other way is by converting the
Texinfo files to AmigaGuide® hypertext files.
