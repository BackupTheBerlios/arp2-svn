   As a special exception, you may use this library as part of a free software
   library without restriction.  Specifically, if other files instantiate
   templates or use macros or inline functions from this library, or you compile
   this library and link it with other files to produce an executable, this
   library does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by
   the GNU General Public License.  This exception does not however
   invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by
   the GNU General Public License.
