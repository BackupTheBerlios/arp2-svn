The original license for libnix was, eh, well, there was none. It was
put into the public domain by its authors, Gunther Nikl and Matthias
Fleischer.

That's all fine, but it also meant that I could not get hold of
libnix/PPC, which forced me to work more than I would have to
otherwise. I don't like to work, and since I know you feel the same,
*this* version of libnix is LGPL:ed.
