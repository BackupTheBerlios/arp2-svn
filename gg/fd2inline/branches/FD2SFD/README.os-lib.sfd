Place your SFD files here.

* The official AmigaOS SFDs goes into the "amigaos" directory.

* MorphOS does not come with SFD files, so you have to generate them
from the official FD files instead.

* You can add your own SFDs in the "3rd" directory.

* 3rd party SFDs that should only be available for the AmigaOS
compiler goes into 3rd-amigaos.

* 3rd party SFDs that should only be available for the Amithlon
compiler goes into 3rd-amithlon.

* 3rd party SFDs that should only be available for the MorphOS
compiler goes into 3rd-morphos.


The directories are processed differenly depending on the target.


* For the AmigaOS compiler, the amigaos, amigaos-3rd and 3rd
directories are processed.

* For the Amithlon compiler, the amigaos, amithlon-3rd and 3rd
directories are processed.

* For the MorphOS compiler, the amigaos, morphos, morphos-3rd and 3rd
directories are processed.


Don't forget to add the include files in ".../os-include/XXX" as
well.
