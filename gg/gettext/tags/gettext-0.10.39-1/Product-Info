Internationalization library and tools
.description
The gettext package provides needed tools and library functions to help with
internationalizing program.

The goal of this library was to give a unique interface to message handling
functions.  At least the same level of importance was to give the
programmer/maintainer the needed tools to maintain the message catalogs.
The interface is designed after the proposals of the Uniforum group.  So
systems having this interface implemented in their C library don't need the
library provided here (and it will automatically not be included).  If your
systems C library implements the second widely available approach (X/Opens
catgets) the library will use this and only some stubs will be compiled to
provide the needed interface.  If neither is locally available a full
implementation of the library will be compiled.
