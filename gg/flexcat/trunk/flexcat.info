FlexCat V2.4 Documentation
**************************

   This file describes the Usage of FlexCat V2.4, a program which
generates catalogs and the source to handle them. FlexCat works similar
to `CatComp' and `KitCat', but differs in generating any source you
want. This is done by using the so called `Source descriptions', which
are a template for the code to generate. They can be edited and hence
adapted to any programming language and individual needs. (Hopefully!)

Survey
******

   Since Workbench 2.1 the Amiga offers a rather pleasant system of
using programs in different languages: The `locale.library'. (This is
called localizing, that's what the name's for.)

   The idea is simple: You select a language, the english in most cases
and write your program in the same manner as you did without
localizing, except that constant strings are replaced by certain
function calls. Another function call makes it possible that the user
selects another language when the program starts. (The latter function
call loads an external file, the so called `catalog' and makes the
former to read the strings from the catalog instead of using the
predefined strings.)

   These catalogs are independent from the program. All you need to do
for adding another language is to create a new catalog file and this is
possible at any time without changing the program.

   But there are additional tasks for the programmer: He needs to
create the catalogs, the predefined strings and some source to handle
them all. (The functions that are mentioned above.) FlexCat is designed
to make this in an easy and nearly automatic manner without losing
flexibility especially in creating the source. An example should make
this clear:

   Lets assume that we want to write a `HelloLocalWorld.c'. Our final
program will look like this:
         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <stdlib.h>
         #include <HelloLocalWorld_Cat.h>  /*  You *must* include this! */
     
         void main(int argc, char *argv[])
         {
           printf("%s\n", msgHello);
         }

Note that this is quite the same as the original `HelloWorld.c' except
for replacing the string "Hello, world!" with a constant `msgHello'.

   These constants and the related strings are defined in a so called
`Catalog description' file. *Note Catalog description::. You always
start by creating such a file called `HelloLocalWorld.cd', which could
look like this:
         ;   Comments are allowed, of course! Each line beginning with a
         ;   semicolon is assumed to be a comment
         ;
         ;   The language of the builtin strings:
         #language english
         ;
         ;   The catalog version, used for a call to Locale/OpenCatalog().
         ;   This is different to Exec/OpenLibrary(): 0 means any catalog
         ;   version, other numbers must match exactly!
         #version 0
         ;
         ;   This defines a string and the ID which allows to use it.
         ;   The number 4 says, that this string must not be shorter than
         ;   4 characters.
         msgHello (/4/)
         Hello, world!

   By using FlexCat you create another two files from the catalog
description: The include file `HelloLocalWorld_Cat.h' defines the
constants and the `HelloLocalWorld_Cat.c' contains an array of strings
and some initializing functions.  You don't need to know what they do,
just use them. Especially you don't need to know anything about the
`locale.library'!

   However, you might be interested, how these files look or even more,
you might want to modify them. This is the difference between FlexCat
and other catalog generators: With FlexCat you are not bound to a
certain builtin format these files have.  Instead it uses external
template files, so called `Source descriptions'. This makes it
possible, for example, to allow using catalogs with AmigaDOS 2.0. *Note
Source description::.  If you use the source descriptions from the
FlexCat distribution you can create the source files with the following
commands:
         `FlexCat HelloLocalWorld.cd HelloLocalWorld_Cat.c=C_c.sd'
         `FlexCat HelloLocalWorld.cd HelloLocalWorld_Cat.h=C_h.sd'

   When your program is ready, you use FlexCat again to create so called
`Catalog translation' files, one for each language you would like to
support. (Except english, which is builtin.) *Note Catalog
translation::.  Lets create a german catalog translation:
         `FlexCat HelloLocalWorld.cd NEWCTFILE Deutsch.ct'

This file would now look as follow:
         ## version
         ## language
         ## codeset 0
         ;   Comments ar eallowed, of course! Each line beginning with a
         ;   semicolon is assumed to be a comment
         ;
         ;   The language of the builtin strings:
         ;
         ;   The catalog version, used for a call to Locale/OpenCatalog().
         ;   This is different to Exec/OpenLibrary(): 0 means any catalog
         ;   version, other numbers must match exactly!
         ;
         ;   This defines a string and the ID which allows to use it.
         ;   The number 4 says, that this string must not be shorter than
         ;   4 characters.
         msgHello
     
         ;Hello, world!

You see, it looks much like the catalog descriptions. FlexCat includes
the comments from the catalog description, even where it is
meaningless: Note the comment on the string length which shouldn't
appear here as these informations must be in the catalog description
only. All you have to do now is to fill in the informations on the
version (a typical version string like `$VER: Deutsch.catalog 1.2
(06.03.98)' is expected), the language of the catalog translation
(`Deutsch' for german here), the codeset (which should always be 0 for
now, see Locale/OpenCatalog() for details) and of course the strings
itself. FlexCat includes the original strings as comments, so you
always know what to fill in.  Finally you create the catalogs with
commands like
         `FlexCat HelloLocalWorld.cd Deutsch.ct CATALOG Deutsch.catalog'

Note, that you don't need the program itself or the source files created
with FlexCat for the catalogs! You can create new catalogs at any time.
It is usual to supply distributions with a file FlexCat.ct, so users
can create own catalogs.

   But what happens if you change the program later? Just edit the
catalog description and use FlexCat to update the catalog translations:
         `FlexCat HelloLocalWorld.cd Deutsch.ct NEWCTFILE Deutsch.ct'

All you need to do now is to enter new strings if needed.

Installation
************

   FlexCat is written in pure Ansi-C (except for the localization),
hence it should run on any Amiga and hopefully on other machines after
recompiling.  (The localizing is commented out in that case.) This
holds for the created programs too: FlexCat is written using itself.
All distributed source descriptions should create programs running on
any Amiga and even any machine. (Of course you must ensure that the
variable LocaleBase has the value `NULL' in the latter case.)
Localizing, however, is possible beginning with Workbench 2.1 because
the `locale.library' isn't available below.

   It is not impossible to offer localizing without the
`locale.library': The source description files `C_c_V20.sd' and
`C_h_V20.sd' give an example, where the `iffparse.library' is used to
replace the `locale.library', if it is not available. This gives
Localizing for Workbench 2.0. *Note C::.

   Installing FlexCat is simple: Just copy the program to a directory
in your search path and select a place for the source descriptions you
need.  (These are the files called something like `xx_yy.sd', where `xx'
is the programming language.) Probably you want to set the environment
variable FLEXCAT.PREFS or FLEXCAT_SDDIR. *Note Program start::.

   If you want to use FlexCat in another language than the english you
need to copy the respective catalog files too.  E.g. for the german
language copy the file `Catalogs/Deutsch/FlexCat.catalog' to
`Locale:Catalogs/Deutsch/' or to `PROGDIR:Catalogs/Deutsch/' , where
`PROGDIR:' is FlexCat's program directory. *Note Using FlexCat source::.

Calling FlexCat from the CLI
****************************

   FlexCat is a CLI based program and doesn't operate from the
workbench.  It's calling syntax is

     FlexCat CDFILE/A,CTFILE,CATALOG/K,NEWCTFILE/K,SOURCES/M,WARNCTGAPS/S,
             NOOPTIM/S,FILL/S,FLUSH/S,NOBEEP/S,NOLANGTOLOWER/S,NOBUFFEREDIO/S,
             MODIFIED/S,QUIET/S,COPYMSGNEW/S,OLDMSGNEW/K

Please note, that due to FlexCat portability, the argument parsing is
not quite standard. Most notably, the only keywords you can (and must)
specify are CATALOG and NEWCTFILE (those of type "/K"), others should
be ommited, or be badly taken as argument itself. This is going to
change probably in the next release.

   Since v1.9, FlexCat implements simple preferences mechanism, which
allows you to change default behaviour of FlexCat. *Note Preferences::.

   And now, the arguments meaning:
*CDFILE*
     is the name of a catalog description to be read. This is always
     needed.  Please note, that the base name of the source description
     is created from it making this case significant. *Note Source
     description::.

*CTFILE*
     is the name of a catalog translation file to be read. This is
     needed for creating catalogs or for updating an old catalog
     translation file using the NEWCTFILE argument: FlexCat reads the
     old file and the catalog description and creates a new catalog
     translation file containing the old strings and possibly some
     empty lines for new strings.

*CATALOG*
     is the name of a catalog file to be created. This argument
     requires giving CTFILE as well.

*NEWCTFILE*
     is the name of a catalog translation file to create. FlexCat reads
     strings from CTFILE, if this is given, strings missing in the
     catalog translation are replaced by empty lines. (The new catalog
     translation will contain only empty lines as strings, if CTFILE is
     omitted.)

*SOURCES*
     are the names of source files to be created. These should be given
     in the form `source=template' where `source' is the file to create
     and `template' is the name of a source description file to be
     scanned.

     If the source description isn't found, FlexCat tries to open a
     file with the same name in the directory `PROGDIR:lib'. (The
     subdirectory `lib' of the directory where the binary FlexCat
     itself lives.)  You can overwrite this default with the
     environment variable FLEXCAT_SDDIR. Example:
              `FlexCat FlexCat.cd FlexCat_Cat.c=Templates/C_c_V20.sd'

     would look for a file `Templates/C_c_V20.sd' in the current
     directory first. If this wouldn't be found and no variable
     FLEXCAT_SDDIR would be present, FlexCat would look for
     `PROGDIR:lib/Templates/C_c_V20.sd'. But if FLEXCAT_SDDIR would
     exist and have the value `Work:Flexcat', for example, then the
     existence of `Work:FlexCat/Templates/C_c_V20.sd' would be checked.

*WARNCTGAPS*
     usually FlexCat doesn't warn about symbols missing in the catalog
     translation. This option will switch on such warnings.

*NOOPTIM*
     Normally, if both strings (source in #?.cd file and translation in
     #?.ct one) are equall, FlexCat assumes there's no need to write it
     to the catalog file as it should be in program built-in string
     table already, from which it will be taken.  But if you want, for
     some reasons these strings to be written (or in another words:  if
     you want all strings to be written) use NOOPTIM.

*FILL*
     This feature is highly useful for the translators.  Normally,
     while working on the translation you got some strings still empty
     as you are working on them.  But it obvious you want to check
     currently translated strings.  Unfortunately all catalog creators
     including FlexCat write all empty strings too, which cause empty
     buttons or simmilar things to happen.  Switch to forbid empty
     strings is not a good solution because prevents you from having
     such if you need.  Also some bad written program may requre all
     strings to be in the catalog (even empty) e.g.  due to lack of
     built-in strings.  Using FILL option you force FlexCat to write
     source string (from `#?.cd' file) everytime it catch translation
     to be empty or be not present at all.  NOTE:  this is only for
     testing purposes.  Final catalogs should always be created with no
     FILL swich used!

*FLUSH*
     This switch is useful when you are translate and test your
     translation simultanously. As AmigaOS caches catalogs (as well as
     libraries, fonts, devices etc) in memory, you need to flush it
     (e.g. using `C:AVAIL FLUSH' command) every time you want new
     catalog to be reread from the disk (instead of using cached copy).
     If you specify this switch while creating the catalog, FlexCat
     will automatically flush all unused things from the memory. NOTE:
     FLUSH works only when you create new catalog. Otherwise it will be
     ignored.  Example:
              `FlexCat Test.cd Test.ct CATALOG Test.catalog FLUSH'

*NOBEEP*
     Since version 1.9, FlexCat will do DisplayBeep() to notice you
     about the problems it encountered. Such behaviour is very useful
     when you call FlexCat from environment without standard output
     (e.g. you launch the script form the DOpus or other tool, etc). Of
     course you may don't like these beeps (however FlexCat is smart
     enough and beep only once, even you receive 20 warrnings, so don't
     be afraid of any beep-bombing). In such case use NOBEEP switch to
     shut FlexCat up.

*NOLANGTOLOWER*
     Normally, FlexCat makes #language entry argument (from #?.ct file)
     lowercased using utility.library call. Utility library calls
     locale.library if present, but I was reported that due to broken
     conversion table in some locales (czech for instance), it leads to
     incorrect strings. So this switch is the workaround for that
     problem. I strongly suggest to force your locale author to fix
     that bug, as some tools may also give you wrong results. And
     rememeber to keep #language name lowercased manually, if you need
     to use that switch (but don't use it unless really necessary).

*NOBUFFEREDIO*
     Buffered IO makes running faster the most applications that often
     do I/O.  So does FlexCat 2.0+. The speed up is mostly noticeable
     on systems using pooling devices (like (E)IDE), but the gain will
     also be reached on DMA bases systems (SCSI). FlexCat uses two 2KB
     buffers, so if you really think that's not the feature you like,
     that's the way to disable it.

*MODIFIED*
     This option tells FlexCat to compile the catalog only then, when
     the source #?.cd or #?.ct file were changed since last catalog
     creation. When catalog file is older than its sources, FlexCat
     just quits. This option is very useful when you want to create
     kind of shell scripts to process and compile more catalogs at once
     (e.g. for OS localisation or programs like DOpus5), and don't want
     to waste your time for recompilation of nonmodified catalogs.

              `FlexCat File.cd File.ct CATALOG File.catalog MODIFIED'

*QUIET*
     Tells FlexCat to keep mouth shut unless really necessary.  It
     means that you won't see any warning messages.  Errors will be
     reported.

              `FlexCat File.cd File.ct QUIET'

*COPYMSGNEW*
     While updating catalog translation file with new #?.cd file,
     FlexCat usually marks newly added strings with ***NEW*** string
     (see the Preferences related chapter to find out how to customize
     this string), which is very useful and lets you easily catch all
     the new things that had appeared since last release.
     Unfortunately, previous versions of FlexCat (pre 2.2) didn't copy
     those markers from old #?.ct to updated one, which forced user to
     either update only completely translated #?.ct files which didn't
     recuire them any longer, or to keep them by hand in any way. This
     was quite annoing, so v2.2 comes with the solution for that
     problem - FlexCat is now aware of presence of such markers and
     when this option is turned on, it simply copies them form old #?.ct
     to updated one.

              `FlexCat New.cd Old.ct NEWCTFILE Updated.ct COPYMSGNEW'

     By default, COPYMSGNEW searches for ***NEW*** string and treats it
     as new string marker. But if you were using something different
     than default string, you need to specify it using OLDNEWMSG,
     otherwise FlexCat won't catch them:

              `FlexCat New.cd Old.ct NEWCTFILE Updated.ct COPYMSGNEW OLDMSGNEW=**Neu**'

*OLDNEWMSG*
     This option needs to be used together with COPYMSGNEW to take
     effect.  By default, COPYMSGNEW searches for ***NEW*** string and
     treats it as new string marker. But if you were using something
     different than default string, you need to specify it using
     OLDNEWMSG, otherwise FlexCat won't catch them:

              `FlexCat New.cd Old.ct NEWCTFILE Updated.ct COPYMSGNEW OLDMSGNEW=**Neu**'

*NOSPACE*
     When the #?.ct file is created by FlexCat, the original string is
     always placed as the comment, which is a must-have reference for
     doing further translation. By default, FlexCat writes those in the
     following way:

              `; this_is_original_string'

     As some people does not like that extra space between ';' and the
     text itself, using NOSPACE switch may appear the cure. When this
     option is specified (either in command line or in prefs file),
     your comments will look like the one below:

              `;this_is_original_string'

   For further examples of command lines see *Note Survey::..

Changing default behaviour of FlexCat
*************************************

   Since version 1.9 FlexCat implements simple preference mechanism.
By using environmental variable FLEXCAT.PREFS you can change program's
default behaviour.

   Variable FLEXCAT.PREFS is parsed using dos.library ReadArgs() call,
thus all switches should be typed in one line with space as switch
separator. The preferences template looks as follow:

     SDDIR/K,NEW_MSG/K,WARNCTGAPS/S,NOOPTIM/S,FILL/S,FLUSH/S,NOBEEP/S,QUIET/S,
     COPYMSGNEW/S,OLDMSGNEW/K/,NOSPACE/S

*NEW_MSG*
     can be used to customize the text, FlexCat uses to mark new strings
     apparing while updating the catalog translation file (using new
     description file and old translation). The default string is
     ***NEW***.

     For detailed information about other tags, please read the *Note
     Program start::.  chapter.

     Note concerning SDDIR: while creating source file FlexCat firstly
     check the current dir, then directory set in preferences. If it
     still fails, it read FLEXCAT_SDDIR variable and finally the
     `"PROGDIR:lib/"' drawer. So using both preferences variable and
     FLEXCAT_SDDIR you can use two custom descriptors' drawers
     simultaneously.

Catalog description files
*************************

   A catalog description file contains four kinds of lines.

*Comment lines*
     Any line beginning with a semicolon is assumed to be a comment
     line, hence ignored. (The string lines below are an exception.
     These may begin with a semicolon.)

*Command lines*
     Any line beginning with a '#' (with the same exception as above)
     are assumed to be command lines. Possible commands are:
    `#language <str>'
          gives the programs default language, the language of the
          strings in the catalog description. Default is `#language
          english'.

    `#version <num>'
          gives the version number of catalogs to be opened. Note that
          this number must match exact and not be same or higher as in
          `Exec/OpenLibrary'.  An exception is the number 0, which
          accepts any catalog. Default is `#version 0'. See
          `Locale/OpenCatalog' for further information on catalog
          language and version.

    `#lengthbytes <num>'
          Instructs FlexCat to put the given number of bytes before a
          string containing its length. The length is the number of
          bytes in the string without length bytes and a trailing `NUL'
          byte. (Catalog files and hence catalog strings will have a
          trailing `NUL' byte. This is not always true for the default
          strings, depending on the source description file.)  `<num>'
          must be between 0 and sizeof(long)=4, Default is
          `#lengthbytes 0'.

    `#basename <str>'
          Sets the basename of the source description. *Note Source
          description::.  This overwrites the basename from the command
          line argument CDFILE.  *Note Program start::.  Commands are
     case insensitive.

*Description lines*
     declare a string. They look like `IDSTR (id/minlen/maxlen)' where
     `IDSTR' is a identifier (a string consisting of the characters
     a-z,A-Z and 0-9), `id' is a unique number (from now on called ID),
     `minlen' and `maxlen' are the strings minimum and maximum length,
     respectively. The latter three may be missing (but not the
     characters `(//)'!) in which case FlexCat chooses a number and
     makes no restrictions on the string length.  Better don't use the
     ID's, if you don't need. The lines following are the

*String lines*
     containing the string itself and nothing else. These may contain
     certain control characters beginning with a backslash:
    `\b'
          Backspace (Ascii 8)

    `\c'
          Control Sequence Introducer (Ascii 155)

    `\e'
          Escape (Ascii 27)

    `\f'
          Form Feed (Ascii 12)

    `\g'
          Display beep (Ascii 7)

    `\n'
          Line Feed, newline (Ascii 10)

    `\r'
          Carriage Return (Ascii 13)

    `\t'
          Tab (Ascii 9)

    `\v'
          Vertical tab (Ascii 11)

    `\)'
          The trailing bracket which is possibly needed as part of a
          `(..)'  sequence, see *Note Source description::..

    `\\'
          The backslash itself

    `\xHH'
          The character given by the ascii code `HH', where `HH' are hex
          digits.

    `\OOO'
          The character given by the ascii code `OOO', where `OOO' are
          octal digits.  Finally a single backslash at the end of the
     line causes concatening the following line. This makes it possible
     to use strings of any length, FlexCat makes no assumptions on
     string length.

   A string is hence given by a description line and the following
string line.  Let's see an example:
         msgHello (/4/)
         Hello, this is english!\n

The ID is missing here, so FlexCat chooses a suitable number. The
number 4 instructs FlexCat, that the following string must not have
less than four characters and it may be of any length. See the file
`FlexCat.cd' for a further example.

Catalog translation files
*************************

   Catalog translation files are very similar to catalog descriptions,
except for other commands and having no informations on string ID and
length.  (These are taken from the catalog description.) Any string
from the catalog description must be present (However, FlexCat omits
writing strings into the catalog which are identical to the default
string.)  and no additional identifiers may occur. This is easy assured
by using FlexCat to create new catalog translation files. *Note
Survey::.

   The commands allowed in catalog translations are:
`##version <str>'
     Gives the catalog version as AmigaDOS version string. Example:
              `##version $VER: FlexCat.catalog 8.3 (06.03.98)'
     The version number of this catalog is 8. Hence the catalog
     descriptions version number must be 0 or 8.

     You may replace the date string `27.09.93' with special keyword
     `$TODAY'.  While creating catalog, `$TODAY' will be replaced by
     current date (note, only 1st occurance of `$TODAY' in `$VER'
     string will be processed).  If you want your version strings to
     always be recent type i.e.:
              `$VER: FlexCat.catalog 2.2 $TODAY'

`##rcsid $Date: 1999/08/18 14:33:00 $ $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $ $Id: FlexCat_english.texinfo,v 1.1.1.1 1999/08/18 14:33:00 carlos Exp $'
     can be used in conjunction with a revision control system instead
     of ##version. `<date>' is the date in the form `yy/mm/dd', `time'
     is the time (ignored), `<rev>' the revision and `<name>' the name
     to be used in the version string.

`##name <name>'
     is present for CatComp compatibility only. It replaces the
     `<name>' argument in the `##rcsid' command.

`##language <str>'
     The catalogs language. Of course this should be another language
     than the catalog descriptions language. The `##language' and
     `##version' commands must be present in a catalog translation.

`##codeset <num>'
     Currently not used, must be 0. This is the default value.

`## chunk <ID> <string>'
     Adds a chunk ID to the catalog which consists if the given
     <string>.  Usually one uses this to add comments to the catalog.
              ## chunk AUTH German catalog translation by Jochen Wiedmann

   The string from above looks like this in the catalog translation:
         msgHello
         Hallo, dies ist deutsch!\n

See `Deutsch.ct' as further example of a catalog translation.

Source description files
************************

   This is the special part of FlexCat. Until now there is nothing that
CatComp, KitCat and others don't offer too. The created source should
make it easy, to use the catalogs without losing flexibility. Any
programming language should be possible and any requirements should be
satisfyable.  This seems like a contradiction, but FlexCat's solution
are the source description files containing a template of the source to
be created. These are editable as the catalog description and
translation files are, hence FlexCat can create any code.

   The source descriptions are searched for certain symbols which are
replaced by certain values. Possible symbols are the backslash
characters from above and additionally sequences beginning with a `%'.
(This is well known for C programmers.)
`%b'
     is the base name of the catalog description. *Note Program start::.

`%v'
     is the version number of the catalog description. Don't mix this
     up with the catalog version string from the catalog translation.

`%l'
     is the catalog descriptions language. Please note, that this is
     inserted as a string. See `%s' below.  below.

`%n'
     is the number of strings in the catalog description.

`%%'
     is the character `%' itself.

   But the most important thing are the following seqences. These
represent the catalog strings in different ways. Lines containing one
or more of these symbols are repeated for any String.

`%i'
     is the identifier from the catalog description.

`%nd'
`%nx'
`%nc'
     is the strings ID in decimal, hexadecimal or octal characters,
     respectively.  The number `n' tells FlexCat, how many characters
     the ID should use (the string will be filled with Zeros at the
     left). You may omit `n': In this case the ID will take just the
     number of characters it needs.

`%e'
     is the number of this string. Counting begins with 0.

`%s'
     is the string itself; this will be inserted in a way depending on
     the programming language and can be controlled using the commands
     `##stringtype' and `##shortstrings'.

`%na'
     is the string's ID. The difference between `%na' and e.g. `%nx' is
     that the `%na' produces string's ID *parted* to single bytes:
            `%2a' in source descriptor will produce `\x00\0x20'
     You may omit `n'. In this case the ID will take 4 bytes.

`%nt'
     is the string's len. Please note, that the result value is always
     *even*.

`%z'
     this item should be used together with `%nt'. Because `%nt' always
     returns even value having desriptor line like:
          static const char Block[] =
          {
               "%2a" "%2t" %s "%z"
          };
     may lead to problems, especially while parsing such table, because
     `%2t' might be even while real string's `%s' lenght may be odd! So
     while parsing you read or skip one byte too much (I guess
     consequences are known). To avoid such problems `%z' was
     introduced. FlexCat replaces it with as many bytes (`\x00') as
     many string's lenght lacks to even. So if string is 3 bytes long
     `%nt' returns `4' and `%z' adds one `\x00'

`%(...)'
     inserts the text between the brackets for any string except the
     last.  This is probably needed in Arrays, if the array entries
     should be separated by commas, but the last entry must not be
     followed by a comma. You can use `%(,)' in that case. Note that
     within the brackets there is no replacing of `%' sequences.
     Backslash sequences, however, are still allowed.

   The control sequences `%l' and `%s' create strings. But how strings
look depends on the program language. That's why the source description
allows command lines similar to the catalog translation. These must
begin with the first character of the line and any command must have
its own line.  Possible commands are:
`##shortstrings'
     makes longer strings to be splitted on different lines. This is
     probably not always possible or not implemented into FlexCat and
     hence the default is to create one, probably very long string.

`##stringtype <type>'
     Tells FlexCat how strings should look like. Possible types are
    *None*
          No additional characters are created. An image of the string
          is inserted and nothing else. No output of binary characters
          (the backslash sequences) is possible.

    *C*
          creates strings according to C. The strings are preceded and
          followed by the character `"'. Strings are splitted using the
          sequences `"\' at the end of the line and `"' at the
          beginning of the new line. (The backslash is needed in
          macros.) Binary characters are inserted using `\OOO'. *Note
          C::.

    *Oberon*
          is like string type C, except for the trailing backslash at
          the end of the line. *Note Oberon::. This string type is
          recommended for Modula-2, too.

    *Assembler*
          Strings are created using `dc.b'. Readable ascii characters
          are preceded and followed by the character `'', binary
          characters are inserted as `$XX'. *Note Assembler::.

    *E*
          Strings are preceded and followed by the character `''. A `+'
          concatenates strings which are spread on different lines.
          Binary characters are inserted like in C.

   Let's look at an excerpt from the file `C_h.sd' creating an include
file for the programming language C.
     ##stringtype C
     ##shortstrings
     
     #ifndef %b_CAT_H    /*  Assure that this is read only once. */
     #define %b_CAT_H
     
     
     /*  Get other include files     */
     #include <exec/types.h>
     #include <libraries/locale.h>
     
     
     /*  Prototypes  */
     extern void Open%bCatalog(struct Locale *, STRPTR);
     extern void Close%bCatalog(void);
     extern STRPTR Get%bString(LONG);
     
     /*  Definitions of the identifiers and their ID's           */
     /*  This line will be repeated for any string.              */
     #define %i %d
     
     #endif

Including FlexCat source in own programs
****************************************

   Of course this depends on what source is created and hence on the
source description. What we are talking here about are the source
description files distributed with FlexCat. *Note Source description::.

   All source descriptions should allow using the program without
`locale.library'. However, a global variable called `LocaleBase'
(`_LocaleBase' for assembler) must be present and initialized with NULL
or by a call to `Exec/OpenLibrary'. No localizing is possible in the
former case except when using the source description `C_c_V20.sd'.
This allows localizing on 2.0 by repacing the `locale.library' with the
`iffparse.library'. (A variable `IFFParseBase' has to be present for
this and initialized like `LocaleBase'.) *Note C::.  The programmer
does not need knowledge of these libraries except when creating own
source descriptions.

   There are three functions and calling them is rather simple.

 - : OpenCatalog (LOCALE, LANGUAGE)
     This function possibly opens a catalog. The argument `locale' is a
     pointer to a Locale structure amd `language' is a string containing
     the name of the language that should be opened. In most cases
     these should both be `NULL' or `NIL', respectively, because the
     user's defaults are overwritten otherwise. See
     `Locale.OpenCatalog' for details.

     Non object oriented languages (C, Assembler, Modula) usually call
     these function `OpenXXXCatalog', where XXX is the base name of the
     application: This allows to use different catalogs in the same
     program.

     If the user has `Deutsch' and `Français' as default languages and
     the programs base name is `XXX' this looks for the following files:
              `PROGDIR:Catalogs/Deutsch/XXX.catalog'
              `LOCALE:Catalogs/Deutsch/XXX.catalog'
              `PROGDIR:Catalogs/Français/XXX.catalog'
              `LOCALE:Catalogs/Français/XXX.catalog'

     where `PROGDIR:' is the programs current directory. (The order of
     `PROGDIR:' and `LOCALE:' can get changed in order to suppress a
     requester like `Insert volume YYY'.

     OpenCatalog is of type void (a procedure for Pascal programmers)
     and hence gives no result.

 - : GetString (ID)
     Gives a pointer to the string with the given ID from the catalog
     description.  Of course these strings are owned by
     `locale.library' and must not be modified.

     An example might be useful. Take the string from the catalog
     description example, which was called `msgHello'. The source
     descriptions declare a constant `msgHello' representing the ID.
     This could be printed in C using
              printf("%s\n", GetString(msgHello));

 - : CloseCatalog (VOID)
     This function frees the catalog (that is the allocated RAM) before
     terminating the program. You can call this function at any time
     even before OpenCatalog is called.

FlexCat source in C programs
============================

   C source consists of two parts: A `.c' file which should be compiled
and linked without further notice and an include file which should be
included from any source part using catalog strings and which defines
the ID's as macros.

   The C compilers I know (SAS/C, Dice and gcc) allow automatic opening
of libraries and initialization of the catalogs: Thus you need not call
the functions `OpenCatalog' and `CloseCatalog', your compiler does this
for you. Similarly it calls the `GetString' functions for all catalog
strings from within `Opencatalog'. This allows to simply write
`msgHello' instead of `GetString(msgHello)'.

   If you define a preprocessor symbol `LOCALIZE_V20' to the compiler
(option `-D LOCALIZE_V20' with gcc and Dice, `DEF LOCALIZE_V20' with
SAS/C), you get a program which can use catalogs under OS 2.0: The
`locale.library' is replaced by the `iffparse.library' in that case.
Your program needs an option like `LANGUAGE Deutsch' in that case: I
function `InitXXXCatalog' (`XXX' being the base name of the
application) should be called, if this option is present, which
receives the language name as argument.  This option is ignored, of
course, if you have the `locale.library'.  (It would be possible to do
similar things under OS 1.3, but I don't want to support this obsolete
version anymore.)

   You loose a little bit functionality with this source description:
For example, you cannot supply a `Locale' structure to `OpenCatalog'.
However, 95% of all applications won't miss anything, others need to
modify the source description.

   For an example of a program using these source descriptions see
*Note Survey::..

   `NOTE:'

   Since v1.9, distribution archive contains `CatComp_h.sd' source
descriptor, which can be used with programs utilizing more than one
catalog at the same time. Look inside to see how to update other source
descriptors.

   There're also another new source descriptor by Magnus Holmgren
<lear@algonet.se>.  The files `Cat2h_c.sd' and `Cat2h_h.sd' contains
source descriptors that generates code similar to the one generated by
Cat2h by Nico François (and also Cat2Inc by Magnus Holmgren ;). It uses
a somewhat different approach to string handling, that is small and
fast.

   Rather than storing all string in an array, and scan that one each
time (like CatComp normally does; there are ways around that though),
the first two bytes of a string contains the ID. The "GetString"
function, which takes a string as argument, then only reads these two
bytes into a long word, and the string ID and default string is then
known.

   As of version 1.9, FlexCat is capable of generating that kind of
output, using the %a command. The included files actually use %2a, and
thus, only two ID bytes per string are generated (like Cat2h does).
This should be enough for most applications. If you change the length,
remember that the GetString() function need to be changed accordingly.

   The generated header file defines all strings, and the source file
contains code to open/close the catalog (with autoinit code for SAS/C
and DICE), and a suitable GetString function.  A quick look at the
generated code should be enough to gather all the details, I think.

   The code does currently not support multiple catalogs, nor change of
version number and builtin language.  Easy to add though (e.g.  by
using %b for all names (and references) needed to be unique e.g.
Get%bString() etc), should the need arise.

FlexCat source in C++ programs
==============================

   Using FlexCat source in C++ programs is extremely comfortable: Almost
everything is done by a special class implemented in the files
`C++_CatalogF.cc' and `C++_CatalogF.h'. All you have to do is to rename
these files into `CatalogF.cc' and `CatalogF.h', compile them and
create and compile two additional files using the source descriptions
`C++_cc.sd' and `C++_h.sd'.  The former will create a file with the
strings (which must be compiled too, of course) and the latter will be
included into your own program.  A C++ program which uses FlexCat
source will look like this:
         #include <iostream.h>
         extern "C"
         {
         #include <clib/exec_protos.h>
         }
         #include "CatalogF.h"
         #include "HelloLocalWorld_Cat.h"
     
         struct LocaleBase *LocaleBase = 0;
     
         int main()
         { //  You must open the library here, even if your compiler supports
           //  Auto-Opening: This will usually break if the locale.library
           //  is not present. This is not what we want here as we just use
           //  the builtin strings in that case.
           LocaleBase = (struct LocaleBase *) OpenLibrary("locale.library", 38);
     
           const CatalogF cat(0, 0, HelloLocalWorld_ARGS);
     
           cout >> cat.GetString(msgHelloLocalWorld);
     
           if (LocaleBase)
               CloseLibrary(LocaleBase);
         }
   A modification of gcc's `libauto.a' is available which will even
allow to remove the lines concerning the variable `LocaleBase'.

FlexCat source in Oberon programs
=================================

   There are different source descriptions: `AmigaOberon.sd' is designed
for the current version of the `AmigaOberon' compiler, `Oberon_V39.sd'
is for older versions and `Oberon_V38.sd' uses the `Locale.mod' from
Hartmut Goebel. `Oberon-A.sd' is, of course for `Oberon-A'.

   The function prototypes are
         XXX.OpenCatalog(loc: Locale.LocalePtr; language : ARRAY OF CHAR);
         XXX.GetString(num: LONGINT): Exec.StrPtr;
         XXX.CloseCatalog();

where `XXX' is the basename from the source description.  *Note Source
description::.

   Finally an example using FlexCat source:
         MODULE HelloLocalWorld;
     
         IMPORT  x:=HelloLocalWorld_Cat; Dos;
     
         BEGIN
           x.OpenCatalog(NIL, "");
     
           Dos.PrintF("%s\n", x.GetString(x.msgHello));
     
           (* Catalog will be closed automatically       *)
           (* when program exits.                        *)
         END Anything;


File: flexcat.info,  Node: Modula-2,  Next: Assembler,  Prev: Oberon,  Up: Using FlexCat source

Flexcat source in Modula-2 programs
===================================

   Modula-2 supports a module concept similar to Oberon. This means
that the function names are always the same. Unlike Oberon, however,
Modula-2 needs an implementation and a definition module, that's why
you have to create two files using the source descriptions
`Modula2Def.sd' and `Modula2Mod.sd'. These are adapted for the M2Amiga
compiler. Note, that you need the file `OptLocaleL.def' from version
4.3 of the M2Amiga compiler, too.

   The function prototypes are:
         PROCEDURE OpenCatalog(loc : ld.LocalePtr;
                               language : ARRAY OF CHAR);
         PROCEDURE CloseCatalog();
         PROCEDURE GetString(num : LONGINT) : ld.StrPtr;

where `XXX' is the base name from the source description.  *Note Source
description::.

   Finally an example of a program using FlexCat source:
         MODULE HelloLocalWorld;
     
         IMPORT hl: HelloLocalWorldLocale,
                io: InOut;
     
         BEGIN
           hl.OpenCatalog(NIL, "");
     
           io.WriteString(hl.GetString(hl.msgHello)); io.WriteLn;
     
           hl.CloseCatalog;
         END HelloLocalWorld.


File: flexcat.info,  Node: Assembler,  Next: E,  Prev: Modula-2,  Up: Using FlexCat source

FlexCat source in Assembler programs
====================================

   Assembler source is created for usage with the Aztec Assembler.
This should not be very different to other assemblers and you should be
able to implement own source descriptions. The source consists of two
parts: A `.asm' file which should be assembled and linked without
further notice and an `.i' include file which defines the string ID's
and must be included by the using program.

   The FlexCat-function names are slightly modified to allow the usage
of different catalogs in one file: These are `OpenXXXCatalog',
`CloseXXXCatalog' and `GetXXXString', where `XXX' is the base name from
the source description. The concept is copied from the GadToolsBox and
prooved good, as I think. *Note Source description::.

   As usual the function result is given in d0 and the functions save
registers d2-d7 and a2-a7. OpenCatalog expects its arguments in a0
(pointer to Locale structure) and a1 (Pointer to language string) which
should be NULL in most cases. GetString expects a pointer in a0. You
should not care about what it points to.

   Finally an example of a program using FLexCat source:
     *   HelloLocalWorld.asm
             include "XXX.i" ; Opening this is a must. This
                             ; contains "xref OpenHelloLocalWorldCatalog", ...
     
             xref    _LVOOpenLibrary
             xref    _LVOCloseLibrary
             xref    _AbsExecBase
     
             dseg
     LocNam: dc.b    "locale.library",0
             dc.l    _LocaleBase,4       ; Must be present under this name
     
             cseg
     
     main:   move.l  #38,d0              ; Open locale.library
             lea     LocName,a1
             move.l  _AbsExecBase.a6
             jsr     _LVOOpenLibrary(a6)
     *   NO exit, if OpenLibrary fails
     
             sub.l   a0,a0               ; Open catalog
             sub.l   a1,a1

             lea.l   msgHello,a0         ; Get pointer to string

FlexCat source in E programs
============================

   Since version 3.0 E allows to split a programs in separate modules.
The following describes the usage of `E30b.sd' which works with E3.0b or
later. (Version 3.0a had significant bugs, previous versions might use
`E21b.sd' which needs inserting the created source into the own source
manually.)

   `E30b.sd' creates a module called `Locale' which contains a variable
`cat' of type `catalog_XXX', where `XXX' is the basename from the
source description. *Note Source description::.  A file
`HelloLocalWorld.e' might look like this:
         MODULE '*Locale'
             -> Use this module
     
         DEF cat : PTR TO catalog_HelloLocalWorld
             -> This variable contains all the catalog strings and some
             -> methods. You must declare it in any module using
             -> Localization, but initialize it in the main module only.
     
         PROC main()
     
             localebase := OpenLibrary('locale.library', 0)
                 -> Open locale.library; *No* exit, if it cannot
                 -> be opened: We use the builtin strings in that case.
     
             NEW cat.create()
             cat.open()
                 -> As already mentioned, this is needed in the main
                 -> module only.
     
             WriteF('\s\n', cat.msg_Hello_world.getstr())
                 -> cat.msg_Hello_world one of the strings contained in
                 -> cat. This string declares a method getstr() which
                 -> reads the catalog and returns a pointer to the
                 -> localized string.
     
             cat.close()
             IF localebase THEN CloseLibrary(localebase)
         ENDPROC

Multiple catalogs support
=========================

   Most of currently available source descriptors cannot be used for
programs opening more than one catalog. In later releases it will
surely change, and corrected source desriptors will be part of the
release.

   For now I supply the example of such source descriptor file.  Read
`CatComp_h.sd' to see how should the descriptor be defined to avoid
multiple symols etc. In few words: use `%b' as prefix, suffix or other
part of any name that is the vital part of source. If you table of
strings is named `STRING' replace this by `%b_STRINGS' and you won't
get dublicated lables any longer.

   `CatComp_h.sd' produces source file similar to CatComp's used to
generate, and can be used by those people who wish to use FlexCat but
don't want to significantly change all of own programs.

Further development of FlexCat
******************************

   However FlexCat seems to be almost finished, I got few items on my
TODO list yet.  And of course I'm open for suggestions, tips or critics.
Especially I offer to include new string types because this is possible
with very minor changes.

   I would be pleased, if someone would send me new source descriptions
and I could introduce them into further distributions. Any programming
language, any extensions, provided that they are prooved good by
testing the source in a real existing program. See *Note Support::, for
contact addresses.
