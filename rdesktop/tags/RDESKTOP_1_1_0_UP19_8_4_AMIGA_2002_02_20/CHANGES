		Sebastian Andersson <sa@hogia.net>
	* added cursor support.
		Ben McKeegan <Ben.McKeegan@fitz.cam.ac.uk>
	* w2k connects, caplen +=4 apparently adds w2k support...

U-PATCH5:
	* added support for extended keys, and int. chars.

U-PATCH9:
	* a fix for french servers, who do not support encryption.
		Philippe MARTIN <pmartin@eridan-info.fr>

               Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>
        * hack: temporarly disable long switches on other platforms than Linux, the check does NOT look for getopt_long, it just checks for linux and enables it.

               Ben McKeegan <Ben.McKeegan@fitz.cam.ac.uk>

        * added: isn't using genkb and that stuff anylonger. Instead we're using semantics similar to those of WINE. Some codes are missing that I noticed so far (PB) but in the end this will turn out to be much better.

               Peter Bystrom <peter.bystrom@ub.oru.se>

               Peter Bystrom <peter.bystrom@ub.oru.se>

U-PATCH19-5-3: ( the first two patches were first included in 19-4-1 -- but as you see in the history if you look back, they have been lost... )

                Peter Bystrom <peter.bystrom@ub.oru.se>
U-PATCH19-5-10:
        * fix: fixed a paint problem, orders.c line 531, ROP2_COPY should be ROP2_NXOR.
               Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>

U-PATCH19-6:
	* fix: a license problem. rdesktop in itself is GLP:ed, but one of the libs it used was licensed only for noncommercial use. This issue is now resolved.If you don't have the GMP lib installed you will need it, it's currently available at: http://www.swox.com/gmp/
		Bradley Bell <btb@debian.org>

U-PATCH19-6-1:
	* instead of having some of the ssl lib in the rdesktop code, we link against the library, you need openssl 0.9.6 or compatible.
		Bradley Bell <btb@debian.org>

U-PATCH19-6-2:
        * fix: added -c flag to Makefile, install parts. At gnu platforms this doesn't seem to be an issue, but on others the manual file may be removed, and impossible to rebuild if this flag isn't present.
                Chris Knight <chris@aims.com.au>
        * fix: when destroying window, we never checked if IM was null or not, this could result in core dumps on closure at times.
                Norbert Federa <nfedera@thinstuff.com>
        * fix: support for PowerPC, need align was missing.
                Jacco de Leeuw <jacco2@dds.nl>

U-PATCH19-6-3:
        * fix: support for mips/irix.
                Alexander Antsiferov <smng-alexa@mail.ru>

U-PATCH19-6-4:
        * fix: adding -mips3 flag since it supports more hardware than the default -mips4
                Roger Brown <rogerb@pisco.engr.sgi.com>
        * fix: the fix in the 19-6-3 patch was incorrect, probably due to me (peter) assuming that the -m flag would return mips. Alexander corrected me. Thanks! :)
                Alexander Antsiferov <smng-alexa@mail.ru>

U-PATCH19-6-5:
	* fix: adding -mabi=32 on 32/64 bit irix. 
		Roger Brown <rogerb@pisco.engr.sgi.com>
	* fix: adding lost ctrl1 hangs fix ( got lost somewhere on the road )
                Norbert Federa <nfedera@thinstuff.com>

U-PATCH19-6-6:
	* fix: fixes the cache font problem I ( Vincent ) reported (13/06/2001). Quick explanation: when a "DEMAND ACTIVE" request is received, the data structure must be reset only the fisrt time (at the connection). Else current variables used for orders (postion, size color...) are reset and every thing is broken.
		Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>
	* fix:  correct behavior for Portuguese keyboard
                Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>

U-PATCH19-6-7:
        * fix: used __ARCH, changed to __ARCH__ since this is standard.
                Matthew Wilcox <willy@debian.org>
        * fix: using endian.h instead of checking endianess ourselves.
                Matthew Wilcox <willy@debian.org>
        * fix: -P switch did not work with a value of 100.
                Martin Samuelsson <cosis@lysator.liu.se>

U-PATCH19-7-0:
        * added: a server module. < It doesn't touch the client code >. You have to remove an # in the Makefile to compile it. It should be considered in an alpha state. check the readme.txt file for further information.
                Mark Jonckheere <no.spam.for.me@easynet.be>

U-PATCH19-7-1:
        * fix: fixing the problems with long texts, process_text2(). the familiar "ERROR: get font 7:255"
                Michal Mihalik <mmihalik@sme.sk>
        * fix: forcing signed char change variable in rdp_in_coord() since that is what change is...
               Roger Brown <rogerb@pisco.engr.sgi.com>
        * fix: fixes a problem of composed keys (^ + o = ô) with new Linux distributions (Mandrake 8 and RedHat 7.1) it is bw compatible.
                Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>
        * fix: allow the use of Euro sign (<AltGr><E> for main countries).
                Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>

U-PATCH19-7-2:
        * fix: a minor bug with Michals code in the previous patch. The code has been cleaned a bit as well.
                Michal Mihalik <mmihalik@sme.sk>
        * fix: Alex pointed out that the IRIX build had been broken when we started using endian.h. Let's see if it has been fixed... :)
                Alexander Antsiferov <smng-alexa@mail.ru>
        * fix: might copy data over buffer end ( buffer overflow ) when creating some strings, now username, hostname etc are dynamically created. Some of the code in rdp.c, licence.c, secure.c had to be changed as well as in rdesktop.c, did I miss anything?
                Paul Flinders <P.Flinders@ftel.co.uk> && Peter Bystrom <peter.bystrom@ub.oru.se>

U-PATCH19-7-3:
	* fix: -l switch problem fixed, works with NT4 FR. Not W2k servers.
                    Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>
	* fix: secure.c sec_process_mcs_data function had a problem when dealing with "non-encrypted" connections. A check had to be added to sec_parse_crypt_info to abort the function on nonencrypted frames.
                    Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>
	* fix: endian.h create our own endian.h file on the fly with a little program ( endian.c ) that detects our endianess... Now... this should be compatible on most platforms... :)
 	        Per Kristian Hove <Per.Hove@math.ntnu.no>
	* added: support for null passwords
	        Andreas Pitt <ap@i-ghg.de>
	* added: support for xpos/ypos with to the -g flag.
	        Andreas Pitt <ap@i-ghg.de>
	* fix: hostname may not be longer than 15 ( 30 in UNICODE ) so we cut.
	        Assar Westerlund <assar@sics.se>

U-PATCH19-7-4:
            * fix: blinking border problems in excel, must resent origin.
         	        Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>
            * fix: ctrl wasn't sent at times when using vncviewers. a part of the codepath has been disabled, seems it isn't needed anymore. (?)
         	        Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>
            * fix: in ui_patblt didn't use the x/y origins that rdp provide us with... we do now.
         	        Vincent DEDIEU <vincent@axel.fr>
            * fix: the creation of a local file called endian.h wasn't that wise, since some systems got it already. It became some kind of conflict... Anyway, the file, when created will be called localendian.h instead.
                    problem reported by:  Alexander Antsiferov <smng-alexa@mail.ru>
            * changed: the keyboard layout code, also added long codes. Naming conventions have changed, i.e. "sv" stands for swedish, and not "se". "se" is the code of the country. The author of the patch and I had some disagrements on the naming convention in use, but I believe it is better to follow the iso coding even if it feels funny at first. the LANG= encodings under linux appear to ( and probably other unices ) use a similar encoding, as far as I have noticed anyway. If anyone wishes to know where the iso is, it is available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm . If too many ppl bulks on the mailing list, I may consider changing it, if you can find a good reason for it.
                     Michal Mihalik <mmihalik@sme.sk>

U-PATCH19-7-5:
            * fix: 8bit color mode without private colormap, didn't check XAllocColor return value, does now.
	    		Ingmar Thiemann <ingmar@gefas.com>
	    * fix: when started by window manager rdesktop could hang on exit while eating cpu.
			Per Kristian Hove <Per.Hove@math.ntnu.no> && Matt Chapman <matthewc@cse.unsw.edu.au>
            * fix: using -N switch witout the -k switch caused a core dump, it has been fixed.
			Valery Sherman <sher@sgi.ru>
	    * fix: removed /usr/include/sys from CFLAGS for Irix and Irix64, it is no longer needed and is causing troubles.. :)
			Valery Sherman <sher@sgi.ru>
            * fix: "true" mouse wheel support, instead of sending scroll up/down events... ( Button4/5 support )
			Bernd Oelker <benni@hspg.de>
            * fix: clear window upon startup, so that cached data is not viewed on screen.
		        Lennert Buytenhek <buytenh@gnu.org>

U-PATCH19-7-6:
            * fix: orders.c in process_polyline, sometimes need copy, sometime needs xor
	    		Jay Sorg <j@american-data.com>
            * fix: an annoying focus problem bug when the mouse moves over an rdesktop window in the background, now we only process drawing events when window is not focused.
	    		Jay Sorg <j@american-data.com>
	    * fix: a minor problem with the focus exposed by above focus fix, we must grab the focus when we open the window, may behave differently in some cases, inform me if the new behaviour annoys you. The problem appears as most troublesome when running without any window manager, and in fullscreen.. :)
	    		Peter Byström <peter.bystrom@ub.oru.se>

U-PATCH19-8-0: ( started the merging with rdesktop 1.1.  19-7-6 is probably more "stable" since I may introduce some bugs in the work. )
            * changed: picked up the configure script and related for rdesktop 1.1, modified them for support for the unified patches. Added simple autodetection of openssl and gmp.
	    * added: crypto/ subdir to match 1.1
	    * added: tests/ subdir for some simple test scripts etc, such as the bigendian/littleendian test.
	    * fix: some potential bugs in iso.c matthew apparently has fixed in 1.1. False was returned instead of NULL, both are usually 0. Didn't affect the codepath, but it is still an error.
	    * fix: sec_rsa_encrypt() have been changed to reflect 1.1
	    * added: capslock/numlock synchronization, fixes an annoying problem when the keys get switched.
			Paul Bludov <paul@ozero.net>

against rdesktop 1.1.0:

U-PATCH19-8-1: ( this version is diffed against 1.1 instead. )
            * added: some more switches to the configure script, --with-ssl-libs= --with-ssl-includes= --with-gui=xwin|win32|svga etc.
	    * added: svgalib gui. ( peter: it is not fully compatible with the patches, so currently it is unusable, but I hope someone will fix it .. *wink* ;) )
	         Donald Gordon <don@dis.org.nz>
	    * added: win32 through the ntxlib. still some things to be done. the xnt.h file needs to be fixed a bit, and so does the xlib.c file... ( peter: nice X-mas project for someone. ;) )
	    * added: --built-in-licence identifies itself as a w2k client.
	    	Ahmon Dancy <dancy@franz.com>

U-PATCH19-8-2: ( Merry Christmas - 2001 )
            * fix: some issues with the configure script.
		Valery Sherman <sher@sgi.ru>
	    * fix: builtin getopt_long was never used.
		Valery Sherman <sher@sgi.ru>
	    * fix: crypto warnings about error() and some more when not using openssl.
		Valery Sherman <sher@sgi.ru>
 	    * fix: some compile warnings
	         Dominik Mierzejewski <dominik@aaf16.warszawa.sdi.tpnet.pl>

U-PATCH19-8-3:
		* add: colourmap cache.
	             Paul Bludov <paul@ozero.net>
		* add: a native win32 port of rdesktop instead of using the ntxlib, use the --with-gui=win32 switch, currently not compiling since it's not adapted to the patches... yet. ntxlib has been removed from the sources in favour of this code.
	             Paul Bludov <paul@ozero.net>
		* fix: I've found, that server sometimes send order "put bitmap X with colourmap X to somewhere", and later "put bitmap X with colourmap Y to somewhere". But rdesktop ignores os->colour_table parameter. Also, rdesktop calls ui_put_colourmap() in process_colcache(). It's absolutelly wrong. It should be called only from process_palette(). process_colcache() should put the colourmap into the cache and nothing else. Later, process_memblt() or process_triblt() command should get it from the cache and pass it to ui_memblt() or ui_triblt().
	             Paul Bludov <paul@ozero.net>
		* add: --with-gui-libs=/--with-gui-includes=. possible issues: these _ADD_ paths, they do not replace currently existing paths to the gui...
		     Peter Byström <peter.bystrom@ub.oru.se>
		* fix: hacked up svga.c to make it run, still some issues with draw_text, not checked why. limits of this gui: svgalib is bound to linux, am also using a thread through the clone command, with some asm, makes this module bound to intel comp hardware, for now. can't use posix threads or linux threads (true?), since they are using signals that the svgalib already uses... :\
		     Peter Byström <peter.bystrom@ub.oru.se>

U-PATCH19-8-4:
		* removed: gmp, not used anymore, since the merge of secure.c with the 1.1.0 release.
		     Peter Byström <peter.bystrom@ub.oru.se>
		* fix: ui_draw_text bugs in the svga gui.
		     Francisco <jfcastro@uol.com.ar>
		* add: data compression, enabled per default, disable with -Z.
                     Norma Jawborski <jawborski@hotmail.com>
		* cleanup/fix: svga.c ui_line.
			Francisco <jfcastro@uol.com.ar>
		* add: begun work of 16bit bitmaps. bitmap.c and secure.c, for now set rdp_bitmap_bits = 16 in rdesktop.c. ( code not finished, AND untested, when tested and working I'll add a switch. )
