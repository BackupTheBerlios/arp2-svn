gl -- short for graphic layers, which you probably figured out already. ;)

currently there are three layers, which work a bit differently. the best one is ofcourse the native one, the xwin.c layer.

the win32 layer in mswin.c

the svga.c layer is a replacement for xwin.c that uses the svgalib. it is currently hardwired for 800x600x256...
