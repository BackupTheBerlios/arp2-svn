This is a X11 based, OpenGL-accelerated Amiga-like graphics
library. Currently, it handles "monitors" (some kind of physical
screen/display), "bitmaps" (a surface you can draw to and display in
various ways), "viewports" (a screen area that displays a bitmap),
"views" (a collection of viewports) and input events from the keyboard
and the mouse.

It is designed to operate at a fixed resolution (like on a flat panel
or projector setup), but does support custom frame rates for smooth
video playback at PAL or NTSC speeds.

In the future, it's going to handle OpenGL for the clients as well,
sprites, bobs and accelerated rendering into bitmaps.

It requires a modern 3D card (DirectX 8 class or better) and
top-quality OpenGL drivers. To be honest, I don't expect to to run on
anything else than NVIDIA's cards.

The following OpenGL extensions are required:

 * ARB_texture_rectangle
 * ARB_vertex_buffer_object
 * ARB_vertex_shader
 * EXT_framebuffer_object
 * EXT_pixel_buffer_object

In addition, the following extensions can be used if present but are
not required:

 * ARB_fragment_shader

The following "Amiga" features are currently supported:

 * The display is composed from one or more viewports. Each viewport
can display one or more bitmaps (like "dual playfield" but up to at
least four bitmaps can be used).

 * The bitmaps in a viewport can be displayed in a different
resolution, be palette based etc.

 * Different viewports can use the same bitmap.

The following extra features are on the to-do list:

 * It is possible to add one or more GLSL vertex and fragment shaders
to a viewport. It is also possible, if the hardware supports it, to
add more additional GLSL fragment shaders to each individual bitmap in
a viewport.
