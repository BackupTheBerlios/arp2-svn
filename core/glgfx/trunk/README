This is a OpenGL-accelerated Amiga-like graphics library. Currently,
it handles "monitors" (some kind of physical screen/display),
"bitmaps" (a surface you can draw to and display in various ways),
"viewports" (a screen area that displays a bitmap), "views" (a
collection of viewports) and input events from the keyboard and the
mouse.

In the future, it's going to handle OpenGL for the clients as well,
sprites and bobs.

It requires a modern 3D card (DirectX 8 class or better) and
top-quality OpenGL drivers. To be honest, I don't expect to to run on
anything else than NVIDIA's cards.
