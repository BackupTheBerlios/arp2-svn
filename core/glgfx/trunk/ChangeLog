	* Nuked glgfx_bitmap_waitblit() and glgfx_bitmap_select().

	* Now uses fragment programs for texturing and coloring. 

	* Uses NPOT 2D textures if texture rectangles is not
	supported. (ATI).

	* glgfx: Too much to list, but I'll try: Does not need PBOs,
	compiles and (mostly) runs on ATI systems, added (required) FBO
	support, context handling, nuked waitblit() etc, added sprites,
	detect __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK, don't redraw screen unless something
	has changed, added normal and scaled blits. And more. :-)

	* glgfx: Cleanup, changed more APIs to use taglists, varargs
	taglists, runtime-check for pixel_buffer_object, correct
	initialization of used OpenGL extensions.
