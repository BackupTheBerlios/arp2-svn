E-UAE 0.8.29-WIP1
=================

This is a fork of UAE, the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, with an emulation core
based on WinUAE. It attempts to bring many of the great features of WinUAE
to non-Windows platforms. This version now finally has a name, E-UAE, since
that's what everybody was calling it anyway. The 'E' can stand for anything
you fancy. Experimental, extreme, exciting, egalitarian, eggplant, . . .

Currently it will build and run (with a varying degree of supported
features) on Linux and other Unices, Mac OS X, BeOS, AmigaOS itself
(either for 68k machines or PPC machines with OS4.0) and the AmigaOS clones
AROS and MorphOS. OS X requires either LibSDL or an X server for graphics
output, but native graphics are supported on AmigaOS and BeOS, although, at
the moment, SDL may be preferred on BeOS since the native driver lacks
support for the P96 emulation.

E-UAE is open-source software and is made available under the terms of the
GPL. See the COPYING file included with the E-UAE archive for details.

E-UAE is based on the work of dozens of contributors including Bernd Schmidt
(the original author and maintainer of UAE), Bernie Meyer (the author of the
x86 JIT compiler), Toni Wilen (the current maintainer of WinUAE), and many
more.

To make full use of E-UAE you will need access to an image of some version
of the Amiga Kickstart ROM (although UAE does include a ROM emulation which
may work with some old games). The Amiga Kickstart ROMs are copyrighted
material and may not be freely distributed (so don't ask me for a copy). If
you don't have an Amiga from which you can legally make a ROM image, a
selection of ROM images are available for purchase online from Cloanto
(publishers of the Amiga Forever distribution). See

What's new since 0.8.28
=======================

General
-------
* Many core emulation changes and fixes merged from WinUAE 1.1.
* Fixed support for autoscroll screens in the P96 emulation.
* Re-written support for emulator traps (including a new portable method to
  call host code from 68k code, replacing the old 'stack magic' method).
* Hence, the 'old' bsdsocket emulation has been entirely replaced by the
  'new' bsdsocket emulation - which should now work on any Unix-like system.
* Improved translation of OCS/ECS colours to host colours (thanks to Francesco
  Pretto and Toni Wilen for this).
* Support for hardfiles larger than 2 GB (thanks to Martin Blom).
* JIT support for NX-enabled CPUs (thanks to Martin Blom).
* Emulator snapshots (state saving/loading) supported.
* Fixed expansion of '~' in config file paths (thanks to Martin Steigerwald
  for reporting this).
* Optimized rendering to 8-bit and 16-bit screens.
* Fixes for building with GCC 4.1.

SDL
---
* The SDL display driver now tries to use video memory if possible for the
  Amiga display (the new rendering optimizations make this feasible now).
  This applies to the X11 DGA SDL display driver, AmigaOS SDL in full-screen
  mode, etc.
* Preliminary support for double-buffered output (thanks to fari mueller for
  keeping up the pressure).
* 'hide_cursor=<bool>' option now supported (thanks to kadi for the idea).

X11
---
* 'x11.hide_cursor=<bool>' option replaced with 'hide_cursor=<bool>'.

Linux
-----
* Reduced latency issues with ALSA sound driver (problems may still exist if
  ALSA's dmix plugin is being used).

OS X
----
* Simplified build scripts when compiling on OS X.
* E-UAE is now a Cocoa App bundle.

AmigaOS (and clones)
--------------------
* Fixed support for 32-bit big-endian screen modes.
* Fixed a fault in the AHI sound driver when exiting.
* Now supports capsimage.device 1.2.
* Added requester for loading and saving state files.


Still to do
===========

The following features of WinUAE are not yet supported:

* Serial and parallel port emulation.
* AHI soundcard emulation.
* Catweasel support.
* OpenGL rendering and graphics filters.
* Floppy drive sounds.
* Everything else that I've forgotten about.

In the pipeline for the full 0.8.29 release
-------------------------------------------

* Load/save state dialogs for Gtk+, Cocoa and BeOS.
* Add logfile= config option to redirect log output to a file (thanks to
  Daniel Pimley for the suggestion).
* Rework handling of default floppy/rom/hardfile paths (again, ta to Mr
  Pimley for the prompt).
* Add DGA 2.0 support to X11 driver (for fari, again. ;-).
* Further build script improvements.
* Transition from CVS to SVN repostories.
* (maybe) Replace libscg for SCSI emulation support on Linux, OS X and BeOS with
  native methods.
* (maybe) Add OpenGL renderer.
* Possibly more, but I ain't telling just yet. ;-)

Known problems
==============

Some significant misfeatures that I know about and am/will be working to fix
(eventually):

* Only platforms supporting the GTK+ toolkit have a useable configuration
  GUI (and the GTK+ GUI is still incomplete).
* JIT direct memory access only works on Linux/x86 and, by default, you may
  only emulate up to 32MB of direct ZIII RAM; select more than that and the
  JIT will fall back on indirect memory access and hence will be slower.
  This is due to a system limit on the size of a POSIX shared memory
  segment. You can overcome this limit my modifying the value of the procfs
  setting, /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax.
* Virtual filesystem doesn't support platforms which use UTF-8 for filenames
  (e.g., OS X, Linux with a UTF-8 locale, etc.). Filenames with characters
  outside of the core ASCII range will be mangled.
* Full documentation is lacking.


Using E-UAE

Documentation is a work-in-progress. See the docs directory.
