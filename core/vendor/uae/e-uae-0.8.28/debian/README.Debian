E-UAE for Debian
----------------

The is an unofficial packaging of E-UAE, an ehanced version of the
Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, for Debian.

Currently this build of E-UAE does not support the SCSI emulation or CAPS
floppy images (due to dependencies missing from the Debian archive). This
will be addressed eventually.
